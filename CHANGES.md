### Changed


## [v1.0.1] - Sunday the 14th of June, 2015

## [v1.0.0] - Sunday the 14th of June, 2015

- Updated to use Ruby v2's keywords.
- Bumped to v1.0.0 as a semver release.


## [v0.0.3] - Wednesday the 27th of February, 2013

- Since the Github repo is called tag-uri (because a hypen is clearer in a URL) I've added tag-uri.rb and taguri.rb to the lib to require the library in case anyone uses the wrong name.


## [v0.0.2] - Wednesday the 27th of February, 2013

- Changed to be a class method, as if it's mixed in to a model then the model will likely want to use that name for the field.
- Changed the module name, it should all be uppercase so now it is.
