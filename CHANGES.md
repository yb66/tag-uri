# CH CH CH CHANGES #

## Sunday the 14th of June, 2015 ##

### v1.0.1 ###

* Improved the docs.

----

### v1.0.0 ###

* Updated to use Ruby v2's keywords.
* Bumped to v1.0.0 as a semver release.

----

### v0.0.3 ###

* Since the Github repo is called tag-uri (because a hypen is clearer in a URL) I've added tag-uri.rb and taguri.rb to the lib to require the library in case anyone uses the wrong name.

### 27th of February, 2013 v0.0.2 ###

* Changed to be a class method, as if it's mixed in to a model then the model will likely want to use that name for the field.
* Changed the module name, it should all be uppercase so now it is.
