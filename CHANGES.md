# CH CH CH CHANGES #

## v0.0.3 ##

* Since the Github repo is called tag-uri (because a hypen is clearer in a URL) I've added tag-uri.rb and taguri.rb to the lib to require the library in case anyone uses the wrong name.

## v0.0.2 ##

### 27th of February 2013 ###

* Changed to be a class method, as if it's mixed in to a model then the model will likely want to use that name for the field.
* Changed the module name, it should all be uppercase so now it is.
